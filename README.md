# The ununzipper

Have you ever downloaded a zip archive and unzipped it only to discover you now have 1.5 million new files and folders in your Downloads folder because the contents of the zip archive were not in a folder when the person created the archive? 

Yeah, I do this all the time. 

This little script will peek inside the zip archive and figure out all the files and folders you just extracted and delete them. Then you can re-run the command inside a folder. 

Enjoy!
